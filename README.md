# Kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to identify how to identify how different Theater Kickstarter campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The most successful Theater Kickstarter campaigns were launched in May. 

While the Kickstarter data includes live campaigns, this data was removed from the analysis because the outcome has yet to be determined.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
There is a downwards trend for Play kickstarter funding goals and their success rates. The campaigns with the highest success rates have the lowest funding goals while the lowest success rates have the highest funding goals

While the Kickstarter data includes live campaigns, this data was removed from the analysis because the outcome has yet to be determined.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Based on the data, the best chance of having a successful outcome is to have a launch date in May.
Based on the data, the worst chance of having a successful outcome is to have a launch date in December.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Based on the data, the goal amount and number of successful outcomes are inversely proportional. The lower the goal, the higher chance of success and the higher the goal, the lower chance of success

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One limitation of the data set is the parameters set on the "Outcomes Base on Goals". The row options include '45000 to 49999" and "Greater than 50000". This setback doesn't allow for goals that are equal to 50000. This parameter caused 2 kickstarter campaigns to be omitted from the data chart, resulting in the number if failed goals in the 500000s to be skewed by 5%.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
